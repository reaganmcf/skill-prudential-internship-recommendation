This Alexa skill will match a user to intership oppurtunities based on avalaible internship oppurtunities and their matching skill set by cross refrencing their user profile with the job descriptions posted on Prudential's website. This skill also allows users to search for Prudential Internships based on keyword.

## Skill Architecture
Each skill consists of three basic parts, a front end, a back end, and data base.

* The front end is the voice interface, or VUI. The voice interface is configured through the voice interaction model.
* The back end is where the logic of your skill resides. 
* The data base contains all the job information and is where the user data is stored.

## Job Matching
Alexa will generate a user profle by asking the user simple questions and will match the user with jobs by parsing the job descriptions and returning the matches. The main filters Alexa will use are GPA, Graduation Year, and Major. 

## Keyword Search
Alexa allows users to search for job posting based on keyword. They can prompt a key word and Alex will reroute them to the Prudential job search website to show them all job postings.
